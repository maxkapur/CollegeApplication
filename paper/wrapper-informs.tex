\ABSTRACT{%
We introduce the college application problem, a submodular optimization problem involving the maximization of the expected maximum value of a portfolio of random variables subject to a budget constraint. We show that this problem is NP-complete and provide two optimization algorithms based on dynamic programming. A modification of the second dynamic program yields a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. These results suggest that the college application problem is a relatively easy instance of submodular maximization.
