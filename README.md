# CollegeApplication
Working repo for my MS thesis, "The College Application Problem," at Seoul National University. You can download the PDF (`paper/paper-en.pdf` or `paper/paper-ko.pdf`) in your preferred language, or clone the repo and run `make` to build from the `paper.tex` source.

If you found this research useful, please consider citing [our arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01869).

This repo also contains slides for 3-, 8-, 15-, and 25-minute (`slides_$(n)min`) presentations of the research. Each slides directory also includes a presentation script (`script.md`) in English and Korean. The 3-minute presentation is written in Reveal.js and can be [viewed online](https://misc.maxkapur.com/CollegeApplication/).

Until this notice is removed, all Korean translations should be regarded as a work in progress.

For the associated Julia package, which implements the algorithms provided in paper, see https://github.com/maxkapur/OptimalApplication.
