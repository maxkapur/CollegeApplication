# CollegeApplication
Working repo for my MS thesis, "The College Application Problem," at Seoul National University. You can download the PDF (`paper-en.pdf` or `paper-ko.pdf`) in your preferred language, or clone the repo to build from the `paper.tex` source.

If you found this research useful, please consider citing [our arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01869).

This repo also slides for 8-minute (`slides_08min`) and 20-minute (`slides_20min`) presentations of the research. Each slides directory also includes a presentation script (`script.md`) in English and Korean.

Until this notice is removed, all Korean translations should be regarded as a work in progress.
